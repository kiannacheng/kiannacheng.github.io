					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that people tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. This helps them recognize objects even when there are parts of them missing. When there is ambiguity, the brain will bounce back and forth between the alternate interpretations until one becomes dominant.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article are the illustrations they use as examples. It is helpful to make sense of the information by seeing an example. Through this, I realize that my brain is interpreting the object the way the article says it is. I also like how the article ties in the Gestalt Principle to UI design which is helpful to display and emphasize certain objects that should immediately attract the viewers.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "As the principle states, items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items should stay further apart." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article a 9. It was very helpful and I will definitely be using this information on my final project. </p>
