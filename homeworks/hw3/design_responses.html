					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from the article is that I need to identify my audience after determining the purpose of my design, because their age, interest, and cultural upbringing will influence my font option. Some fonts are more appropriate for children, while others are more appropriate for seniors.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is when the author says, "Harmonize your type with the rest of your design," and then showed an illustration to prove their point. The graphics had very monotone, faded colors, which make the overall illustration seem soft, and the words complimented it by being bubble letters.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> I found this quote to be compelling and something I need to constantly keep in mind: "Good design aligns its typography with its purpose. This is because typography is key to setting mood, tone, and style in your designs." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article a 9. It was a good read, and I learned a lot from it. I will be keeping all the new information I gained in mind as I continue in this class and even outside this class. </p>
