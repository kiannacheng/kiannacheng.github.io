					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that it is important to keep the duration and speed of the animation in mind. It should be slow enough to allow the users to notice the change, but it should also be quick enough to prevent the users from waiting. It's important to engage the users, but also to not bore them.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is that it's important to remember that the duration of the animation should depend not only on the traveled distance but also on the size of the object. Smaller elements or animation with small changes should move faster. Animations with large and complex elements look better when it lasts a little longer. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or deceleration â€” just like all live objects in the physical world." </p>
						</li>
