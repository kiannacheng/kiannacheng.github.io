                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that UI Interactions help guide the viewers to interact with the app/website. In a way, it compels the viewer to go down a rabbit hole and buy what the creator wants them to buy. There also needs to be high contrast to assert attention on specific functions and appeal to the viewer.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is that there isn't much reading to do. It's all about observing different UI interactions and determining which one allows for the most engagement and interest from the viewers. I love the color palette for a lot of the examples, since they complimented and contrasted each other.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the "Add to Cart Interaction" by Dannniel for Norde. It's very concise, and there's enough contrast to differentiate the different functions. It shows the viewer how to simply customize the shoe to fit the viewer's desire. Because the interaction explains the process, it compels the viewer to do it themselves and then click "Add to Cart." </p>
