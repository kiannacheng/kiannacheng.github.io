            <p>My name is Kianna, and I am a woman in stem! When I am not so overwhelmed with school work, I enjoy chasing sunsets, taking pictures with my digital camera, creating recap videos, reading thrillers, exploring new things, and travelling to the places on my bucket list. I am from Hawaii but grew up in San Diego, and I absolutely love the beach, especially since I live less than 10 minutes away from one. Norcal feels like a different world sometimes, but I am grateful to be at the number one public university. I am really excited to learn all about web design in this decal!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I learned that app designers intenionally use color, text treatment, and specific wording to engage with the viewers and guide their attention to certain functions.</li>
                        <li>My favorite part of this article is the observations the author made about Airbnb, Twitter, and Spotify. It was detailed and made me realize that the hierarchy and content of the apps are so impactful.</li>
                        <li>I found this quote compelling: "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."</li>
                        <li>From a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this article 8. It was an eye-opening read.</li>
                    </ul>
