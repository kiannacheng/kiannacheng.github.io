						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>White space helps guide the user experience. It creates focus points to draw the reader's attention certain elements. The more padding surrounding a particular element, the greater the emphasis on that element. However, too much padding can actually draw the viewer's attention away from the elements, so there needs to be a balance.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Strategically placed white space helps the viewer navigate visual noise on a page that doesn't have the luxury of a lot of white space. White space also helps with visual organization that clarifies sections and different parts of the page. This can help the user feel confident when navigating the page and boosts their site experience.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
