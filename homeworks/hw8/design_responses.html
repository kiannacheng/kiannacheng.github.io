				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I didn't even know Dark Patterns existed, so that is definitely something I learned from this article. I found out that they are deceptive UI/UX decisions that trigger the users to do things they don't actually want to do. Dark Patterns aren't mistakes but used purposely to exploit human psychology and do not have the user's best interests in mind. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>  My favorite part was the list of 11 types of dark patters. Learning about each one of them has made me even more aware of what I have or will encounter on the web and to be cautious about it. For example, misdirection is created when the user's attention is guided to a specific place so they won't nothing something else is happening. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "But with time, they have been improved and are now designed to trick the more aware user as well." It is very important to realize this statement and be aware of what you interact with online. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> This article is a 10 because I learned so much from it and have become more aware of dark patterns and how to defend myself against them and realize when I am interacting with a dark pattern. </p>
