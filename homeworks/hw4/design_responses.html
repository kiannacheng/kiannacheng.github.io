					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I have never really thought about color accessibility in the way this article describes it. I also didn't know there are legal implications for not complying with regulatory requirements around accessibility. It's important to keep accessibility in mind earlier, not only because it's necessary for the viewers but also because it reduces time and money.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is when the author said, "Dont rely solely on color." He then follows his declaration with examples, like using patterns and textures to differentiate what's being displayed. This is so helpful for people who are colorblind, and as designers, we want our clients and viewers to have the best experience possible when nagivating what we've built.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "You can also ensure accessibility by making sure you donâ€™t rely on color to relay crucial system information." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I give this article a 10. This was such an eye-opening read, and I'm really glad I got to learn about accessibility so I can be extremely conscious about it as I move forward with designing websites. </p>
