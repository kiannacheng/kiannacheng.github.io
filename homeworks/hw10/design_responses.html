							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> This was a very informative read, and the different types of attention stood out to me. I learned that as a UX designer, we have to keep in mind that the users need to use their sustained attention, so everything on the interface should serve this goal. It's interesting how important it is that designers need to focus on psychological effects on the users. Focusing on the attention span of users will help designers create elements that keep the users engaged for a long period of time. For example, designers need to understand the processing of information, as well as making sure there's a balance between having enough elements to engage the users and just enough so that there isn't an overload of information.</p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed this article, so I will give it a 9, because I never paid much attention to the psychological intent of designers as they are creating user-engaging websites, apps, etc. It blows my mind that they are able to get the effect they want on their users because they are constantly keeping in mind how the users' brains work.  </p>
